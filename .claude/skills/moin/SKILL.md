  Use at the start of a working session to come up cleanly and orient: read who this project is and what

  all — the current state and the single clearest next step from the living docs. Flag (do not yet run)
  any due recurring maintenance, then ask the owner whether coffee is ready and whether we continue as
  planned. This is orientation, NOT a trigger to start work — it ends with a question, not an action.
  The counterpart to /feierabend.

# Iris Sunshine Oase — Moin (session bring-up & orientation)

Starting a session cleanly is a repeatable procedure — the counterpart to `/feierabend`. Where
feierabend winds the session *down* (tidies git, parks work in flight, brings the living docs current),
`/moin` brings it *up*: it produces a **consistent, complete orientation briefing** from the living docs
rather than an ad-hoc recap, so nothing important is missed on the way in. Follow the steps in order,
read the sources **fresh** (do not trust possibly-stale context), and **report faithfully** — an open PR,
a failing check or a due task is stated plainly.

**Guardrails (do not violate):**

- **Orient, do not start work.** `/moin` ends with a **question**, not an action. Brief the owner, then
  wait for the go-ahead before beginning anything. If the briefing surfaces a new task, note it — do not
  begin it.
- **Read-only.** `/moin` reads and reports; it does not commit, branch or change docs. The *only*
  possible write is a due recurring maintenance task — and only after the owner confirms in step 7.
- **The living docs are the source of truth for state**, not this file and not memory from a previous
  session: `docs/STATUS.md` (state and next steps), the git log and `gh` (work units and open PRs).
- **Owner conversation is German**; repository artefacts stay English (`CLAUDE.md`). The briefing and the
  closing question are delivered in German.

## 1. Project identity — what & why

- **What this is** and what it is for: the top of `CLAUDE.md` ("What this is"). One or two sentences,
  not a wall of text. The load-bearing fact worth repeating on every bring-up: this is the public
  presence of a **real business that is still trading**, and the prices, opening hours and address on it
  are what customers act on.
- **Since when**: the first commit date — `git log --reverse --format="%ad" --date=short | head -1`.
- Name the repository and working directory so it is unambiguous which project this session is in — the
  owner runs more than one.

## 2. Standing rules & skills

- **Standing instructions**: the load-bearing rules from `CLAUDE.md` that shape *how* we work here — a
  compact reminder, not a re-read of the whole file. At minimum:
  - content correctness outranks everything; never invent a price, an opening time or an address
  - bugs before features
  - every change on a branch through an **owner-merged** PR; the single exception is an ADR
    `Proposed → Accepted` status flip
  - ADRs are normative; an `Accepted` ADR means *decided*, not *built*
  - no image without documented provenance; `Archive/` stays excluded; never commit personal data
  - the preview carries `noindex` until go-live
  - English in the repository, British spelling; German with the owner
- **Available skills**: what is in `.claude/skills/` and when to reach for each — currently `moin`,
  `weiterimtext`, `feierabend` and `adr-author`.

## 3. Recent activity — the last work units

- The **last ~6 work units** as merged PRs (the meaningful unit, not raw commits):
  `git log --grep="Merge pull request" --format="%ad %s" --date=short -6`. Fall back to the plain commit
  log (`git log --oneline -6`) if there are few or no merge commits yet.
- Mention a genuinely methodological recent moment only if it bears on today's work —
  `docs/meta/agent-collaboration-log.md` is the home for those, not this briefing.

## 4. Current state — where we stand

- **Git state**: `git status` (branch, clean or dirty) and `gh pr list` — report every open PR awaiting
  the owner's merge, and any parked branch with work in flight.
- **Project state**: `docs/STATUS.md` → *Where we stand* — the honest current-phase snapshot (phase,
  what just landed, what is in flight). Condense it; do not paste the whole file.
- **Ticket state**: `gh issue list --state open` — in particular anything labelled `agent-ready`, and
  any open `type:bug`, which jumps the queue.

## 5. Recurring maintenance — flag, do not run

- If `docs/recurring-tasks.md` exists, check each task's "next check due from" date against today and
  **report** which (if any) are **due**. If the file does not exist yet, say so in one clause and move
  on — it is created when the first genuine recurring task appears (see #14), not before.
- **Do not run a due task here.** List it in the briefing and *offer* to run it as part of the go-ahead
  in step 7. Running maintenance is work; it happens only after the owner confirms. If nothing is due,
  say so explicitly with the next due date — never skip it silently.

## 6. The next step

- From `docs/STATUS.md` → *Next step*, name the **single clearest next step** for this session (not the
  whole roadmap), plus any owner-domain decision that must be settled *before* it. Per `CLAUDE.md`: do
  not implement ahead of a decision, and surface owner-domain questions rather than resolving them
  quietly.
- If the next step touches a business fact (a price, an opening time, the address, the Impressum) and
  the source for that fact is not in `docs/inhalte/`, name that as the blocking question here. It is the
  most common way this project can go wrong.

## 7. Coffee & go-ahead — the close

- Deliver the briefing **concisely in German** (identity, rules and skills, recent work, current state,
  due maintenance, the one next step).
- Then end with the ritual question in German — coffee first, then the direction check, e.g.:
  **"Hast du eine Tasse Kaffee bereit? ☕ Machen wir wie geplant weiter, oder lenken wir um?"**
- If step 5 flagged a due task, fold it into that go-ahead ("… und soll ich zuerst die fällige
  Wartungsaufgabe X erledigen?").
- Then **stop and wait**: begin no work until the owner answers. The answer sets the session's direction.
