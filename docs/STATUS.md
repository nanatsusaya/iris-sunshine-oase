## Maturity legend

So that "decided" is never read as "built", every capability sits at one of:

- **planned** — ticketed, not yet designed
- **designed** — an Accepted ADR exists, no code
- **draft** — built and visible on the preview, not content-complete or verified
- **content-complete** — real content in place, checked against the source or the owner
- **live** — served to the public under the real domain

**An Accepted ADR is `designed`, not `built`.**

## Where we stand

Each phase is tracked as an epic; this section is the summary, the epic is the detail.

| Phase | Epic | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Analysis & foundation | [#2](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/iris-sunshine-oase/issues/2) | ▶ in progress |
| 1 — Decisions (ADRs 0002–0008) | [#3](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/iris-sunshine-oase/issues/3) | ▶ in progress |
| 2 — Scaffold & first preview | [#4](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/iris-sunshine-oase/issues/4) | planned |
| 3 — Content | [#5](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/iris-sunshine-oase/issues/5) | planned |
| 4 — Defects, accessibility, SEO | [#6](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/iris-sunshine-oase/issues/6) | planned |
| 5 — Go-live | [#7](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/iris-sunshine-oase/issues/7) | planned |

**Phase 0 — analysis and foundation** (#2)**:** ▶ in progress.

- ✅ The old WordPress site is analysed and documented (`docs/analyse/`): stack and data situation,
  content inventory, the full price list, the design system, a media inventory, and 28 defects as work
  packages `M-01`…`M-28`.
- ✅ All texts of the old site extracted to [`docs/inhalte/`](inhalte/README.md) via
  `tools/extract-wp-content.mjs` — the only versioned source of the old content.
- ✅ The WordPress export is PII-cleaned (2,216 contact-form submissions, 2 spam comments and every
  real e-mail address removed); `Archive/` is excluded from the repository entirely.
- ✅ `Archive/` cleaned up: 749.7 MB → 594.0 MB, protocol in `Archive/AUFRAEUMPROTOKOLL.md`.
  Backup and archival of it are the **owner's** responsibility, deliberately outside this repository.
- ▶ Process foundation: `CLAUDE.md`, ADR 0001 and the index, this file, the PR template, labels, CI.

**Phase 1 — decisions** (#3)**:** ▶ in progress. ADRs 0002–0008, one PR each (see the
[ADR index](adr/README.md) for the set and its rationale).

- ✅ [ADR 0002](adr/0002-tech-stack-and-tooling.md) — tech stack and tooling — **Accepted**
  (2026-07-18): Astro 7 static with npm, Node 24, TypeScript `strict` with `astro check`, plain CSS
  with custom properties, Biome as a **blocking** check, `@astrojs/sitemap` as the only integration,
  and no unit-test framework until something exists that needs one. State: **designed** — no code yet.
- ▶ ADRs 0003–0008 outstanding. **ADR 0006** (deployment, preview and hosting) is the one on the
  critical path: it is the second of Phase 2's two blockers, so nothing can be scaffolded until it is
  Accepted.
- ⏸ **ADR 0004** (styling and design tokens) waits on input from outside this repository: the owner is
  drafting a visual design for the new site (2026-07-18, in progress). Design tokens invented before
  that design exists would be replaced by it, so 0004 is deliberately *not* the next ADR despite its
  low number. The other six do not depend on how the site looks.

**Phase 2 — scaffold and first preview** (#4)**:** planned, **still blocked**. The Astro scaffold plus
the GitHub Pages deployment, so drafts are reviewable in a browser early. Of its two gates, ADR 0002 is
now Accepted and **ADR 0006 is not yet written**. The epic says plainly: do not scaffold ahead of them.

**Phase 3 — content** (#5)**:** planned. The 14 pages, prices and opening hours as structured data.

**Phase 4 — defects, accessibility, SEO** (#6)**:** planned. `M-01`…`M-28` as tickets, plus the checks that
keep them from recurring.

**Phase 5 — go-live** (#7)**:** planned. Domain cutover from netcup, redirects for the 32 old URLs, removal of
the `noindex` gate. Every step here is owner-approved.

## Decisions taken (not yet ADRs)

Recorded here so they are not lost before the owning ADR is written:

| Decision | Date | Owning ADR |
|---|---|---|
| Maintenance runs through GitHub issues, worked by an AI agent | 2026-07-18 | — (working model, `CLAUDE.md`) |
| Repository artefacts in English; conversation in German | 2026-07-18 | — (`CLAUDE.md`) |
| Site content German by default, English as an additional locale | 2026-07-18 | 0005 |
| Early drafts visible via GitHub Pages, `main` → one preview URL | 2026-07-18 | 0006 |
| Domain stays registered at netcup; DNS points at the host | 2026-07-18 | 0006 |
| Cloudflare Pages hosts the public site; GitHub Pages stays the preview | 2026-07-18 | 0006 |
| No contact form — telephone and e-mail only | 2026-07-18 | 0007 |
| `Archive/` excluded wholesale; no Release upload (public repository) | 2026-07-18 | — (`.gitignore`, `docs/analyse/06`) |

## Open questions for the owner

- **The studio's e-mail address** — needed as soon as the contact form is dropped, because e-mail then
  carries what the form used to. It is **not in this repository**: the PII cleaning of the WordPress
  export replaced it with `studio@example.invalid`, so both `docs/inhalte/seiten/kontakt.md` and
  `impressum.md` show the placeholder. It must come from the owner and must not be reconstructed from
  anywhere else — a wrong address on a contact page silently loses enquiries.
- **Image material** — no image can be used until its provenance is documented. Whether to re-shoot
  the studio or re-license stock is an owner call with cost implications.
- **Content scope** — `docs/analyse/02-inhaltsinventar.md` rates each old page as keep, rework or
  drop. The drops need confirmation.

## Next step

**ADR 0006 — deployment, preview and hosting.** It is the last thing standing between here and a
preview URL: Phase 2 (#4) names ADR 0002 and ADR 0006 as its two gates, and only the first is now
Accepted. Everything Phase 2 promises — the scaffold, the Pages workflow, the `noindex` gate — is
waiting on it, and none of it depends on the visual design still being drafted.

Phase 0's remainder (#11, #12, #17, #18, #19) is low-priority tidying and does not block anything.
